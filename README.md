# FCOM server

**Note:** if you're just looking to use FCOM, please see [the repository for FcomClient](https://github.com/norrisng/FcomClient/).

Also, I would prefer that you don't run an instance of my bot. Just use the one I have!



## Overview ##

Although the bot appears to users as a single, cohesive entity, it actually consists of three separate components:

* A client-facing Flask API
    * Accepts forwarded messages
    * Allows clients to "confirm" a registration token and provide a callsign
        * The API responds with the Discord username (and Snowflake ID) associated with the given token
    * Allows users to deregister (i.e. stop forwarding messages) through the client application
* A Discord bot
    * Sends the forwarded messages to the associated Discord user
* A relational database (specifically, MariaDB)
    * This acts as the link between the two
    * It also stores the mappings between Discord users and FCOM clients

The bot and the API need to be run simultaneously.



## Requirements

Python 3.6+ is required. For required packages, please refer to the included `requirements.txt`. 



## Server setup

### Database ###

#### Initial setup ####

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE fcom;
CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
```

Create the following environment variables for the login:
* Username: `FCOM_DB_USERNAME`
* Password: `FCOM_DB_PASSWORD`

#### Tables ####

See included `schema.sql` file.

### Additional text files ###

#### Discord bot token ####

Create a file named `bot_token.txt`
This file should contain the Discord bot token, and nothing else.

This token can be found at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ 

#### Current client version ####

Create a file named `curr_client_version.txt`. 
This file should contain the current version number in the following format:

```
FcomClient/x.y.z
```
`x.y.z` is the client version number (e.g. `0.8.0`). This string should be updated whenever a new [FcomClient](https://github.com/norrisng/FcomClient/) is released, as users will be automatically notified of a client update upon callsign registration.

### Bot and API ###

First, download from GitHub, then set up `virtualenv`:

```bash
cd FcomServer
python3.6 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install wheel
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file named `bot_token.txt` inside the FcomServer folder (i.e. at the top level). It should contain your bot token, and nothing else.

Then, run both the bot and the API. They must be run simultaneously.

```bash
python3 main_bot.py
python3 main_api.py
```
If you want to have both run in the background, you'll have to set them up as a service on your operating system.

As is the case with any Flask API, please use a production server to serve the FCOM API.
My implementation uses `gunicorn`, but you can use anything, really. If not using the former, you'll have to remove `gevent`/`greenlet`/`gunicorn` from the `requirements.txt` file before installing dependencies via `pip`.

To get out of the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```



#### User registration expiry ####

As of the time of writing, due to difficulties in getting the bot to clean up old registrations, this feature is implemented via a cronjob that runs every 5 minutes.

Implement the following SQL command via any tool of your choice, as long as it can be executed via `cron`:

```mysql
DELETE FROM registration
WHERE  ( is_verified IS TRUE
         AND last_updated < Date_sub(Now(), INTERVAL 24 hour) )
        OR ( is_verified IS FALSE
             AND last_updated < Date_sub(Now(), INTERVAL 5 minute) );
```
